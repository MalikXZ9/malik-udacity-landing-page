Project name: Udacity landing page.

This is a landing page project from the Udacity web development course. Made by me (Malik) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The page should be responsive on any device and the menu will change to be hamburger menu under 600px width.
This page should contains 4 sections (responsive when adding more) with each section creating a list item (li) in the navigation menu that redirects to its section.
Each section should be changing the background and the text colors when it's active, also the navigation should update when each section is active.
There is a "BACK TO TOP" (btt) button thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page (in this case section 1).
And finally the nav bar and btt should be desappearing while the user is not scrolling.
